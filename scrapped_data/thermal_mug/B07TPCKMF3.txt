The flask is robust, ergonomic and easy to use even one handed. The one I bought for my partner turned out to be a little shorter than mine but otherwise almost the same. However the one difference my partner  noticed was that it doesn't keep liquid hot for as long. It's probably ok for three or four hours  but after a little longer it'll be a bit cooler. The conclusion I've come to is that it's fine for drinks on the go as long as you'll consume them in four hours or so. Anything longer than that then a good old flask is possibly better but a lot more inconvenient to use. I'd still buy another Contigo for all it's other excellent features.\n")

I find the lid hole opening to be just a little too small to take big sips as well. I really want to give this 5 stars and for many folk it would be perfect.

Cap also doesn't get warm to the touch even when just filled, well insulated so pretty good all-round.If I was to say anything negative it's that the cup isn't so easy to clean as it's very narrow, but that's a minor niggle. I've read reviews complaining that the finish on the cup doesn't last long but that's not something I'm concerned about as I work in construction, everything eventually gets damaged in my line of work!It does what I want it to do, allows me to take a couple of mugs worth of coffee with me to work and keeps it warm enough to enjoy with lunch, would recommend.\n")

('"ajb1983"', '5.0 out of 5 stars', "\nJ'ai 2 mugs CONTIGO achetés à 6mois d'intervalle.Le Westloop et le Byron.Le look du Westloop me plaisait davantage mais  la bande caoutchouc du Byron évite qu'il n'échappe de la main. Il est facile à tenir et tient bien en main. Les couleurs métallisées sont magnifiques. Mais je n'aime pas ce revêtement caoutchouc ^^Le couvercle plastique sans BP,  est différent sur les deux modèles :Sur le Westloop le système permet de verrouiller le couvercle, afin que rien ne s'écoule du capot en cas de chute. Un petit bouton VERROU (symbole de cadenas) sur le dessus qu'on enfonce dans un sens ou dans l'autre. Facile et ça marche bien. Le système pour boire, est lui, sur le côté du couvercle. Ça paraît plus naturel et plus facile d'appuyer sur un bouton (qui se trouve  à l'opposé de là où on avale) pour boire et relacher ce bouton pour refermer le systeme. On appuie on relâche. C'est tout. Cela ne requiert pas de force.C'est simple ingénieux et c'est facile à  nettoyer  sous le robinet avec liquide vaisselle ou lave vaisselle  (attention seul le bouchon passe au lave vaisselle pas la partie TASSE qui perdrait ses couleurs) .Sur le Byron, le systeme est plus simple  : un bouton solide, qu'il faut LEVER avec le pouce ou un doigt, (personnellement je trouve que c'est quand même difficile) je dois utiliser les deux mains. Vraiment pas pratique. Et pas logique de pousser vers le haut pour ouvrir.ce bouton est relié à une boule qui vient fermer le trou par lequel on boit. Ça fait un bruit net  (mais discret) qui donne confiance, semblable à celui que fait un bouchon de champagne rouvert le lendemain.C'est simple mais une personne qui n'a pas beaucoup de force dans les mains peut avoir du mal. Comme moi.Il n'y a pas de système de verrouillage car le bouton est  plus dur et la fermeture se suffit à elle même.je trouve le système du Westloop plus logique et sans que cela ne demande de la force.- le Byron a une ouverture incurvée qui permet de boire plus naturellement. Le weestloop est tout plat et on risque de se brûler avec aucune sensation de boire dans une tasse. Les deux ont tendance à donner un goût de plastique au caféSi vous voulez enlever le goût de plastique  il faut pendant quelques jours, enfoncer le couvercle dans du marc de café chaud et laisser refroidir. Petit à petit le couvercle va s'imprégner.En ce qui concerne les performances isothermes, le Byron me decoit et tient le chaud vraiment pas longtemps. Je préfère encore le westloopLes peintures métallisées ne vont pas au lave vaisselle et un objet métallique dans un sac provoquera des rayures  (clefs, téléphone portable,  stylo).Pour moi les performances de tenue supérieure de chaleur du Byron NE SONT PAS TENUES. Ou j'ai reçu un exemplaire défectueux.En résumé la construction est solide. Mais je suis déçue de ce modèle tant par son système d'ouverture que par ses capacités thermos\n")

('Mark Williamson', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '\nBought the Contigo Byron thermal mug (v1.0 not the new 2.0 version) last year.  I would rate my use as occasionally for an  year or 2 months of regular daily use.For the advantages - 1.  keeps tea/coffee piping hot easily for several hours.  Even after 5-6hrs it is warm, though not "hot."  2.  Cold drinks keep for even longer - drinks with ice will still have ice cubes 5-6hrs later.  3.  easy to clean needing minimal maintenance.  4.  Easy to drink from, spill-proof - well thought out system even for one handed use (when driving).  5.  Cool enough to touch and handle even when filled with piping hot beverage.The only drawback that I\'ve faced is the seal is not long lasting - once the "washer seal" is warped (see pic), the drinks will spill and lose it\'s benefit(s).  They do not supply seals as stand-alone replacements, nor can you buy just the lid.  The warrantee is advertised as "life-time warrantee" - pursuing this as the last option.  Will keep you updated.May update - The customer service is very helpful, and replaced my lid as I am still under warrantee.  Unfortunately, as stated above this is only a temporary fix, as the warrantee lasts for 2 years.  I wish they would sell parts individually for it is a very nice mug :)\n')

Easy to clean, no nasty extra rubber bits for drinks to sit in and go yucky like some cheaper ones. Just give it a good soak in warm soapy water before wiping inside and rinsing. Simple!

The drink stays as hot as it was when it was made, I've only tested this to around 2-3 hours. I've taken it to the cinema, on bike rides, even to people's houses who cannot make a decent cup of tea. It's easy to clean and doesn't have any tea marks forming, but I wash it straight after use to avoid that happening. Only thing I'd say is I've seen these reduced in a certain supermarket, at least £5 cheaper than on here.\n")

('Andrew Reid', '5.0 out of 5 stars', "\nI bought this as it was cheap and needed a rotation partner for my Contigo transit, which I was using so much, it was starting to get a bit unhygienic. I went for this as it was just 12 pounds which is very good value for money. It actually feels nicer in the hand than the transit, is not as tall while holding the same volume, the heat (and cold) retention is as outstanding as we have come to expect from contigo and the vivacious colour is really nice.Where the transit wins, however, is the closing mechanism. The snap shut aspect of this mug is just not very user-friendly. Certainly not one-handed use as advertised. It's extremely stiff and needs quite a lot of pressure applied. This means you end up leaving it open for sipping and if accidentally knocked over, spillages do occur. The transit is permanently shut by default and you open to sip by pressing a spring-loaded button, which is convenient to use and definitely one-handed. I reach for my mug often when I am working on the laptop/external keyboard so the watertightness aspect is important for me. On that note, I've not noticed any leaking that reviewers are complaining about.That all said, this is still a great mug if you are happy to use two hands to close it after each sip or don't mind leaving it open, just 12 quid too. Only 4 stars from me though.My recommendation, if you are in two minds, is to go for one of their autoseal mugs - absolute peace of mind and convenience that way.\n")

I used a couple of times for now no leaks and keeps very hot that I have to wait my coffee to cool before I seal the lid.

I will update this In a year- not so expensive (bought it for £12) for the brand- keeps warm for hours good for taking for long walks- lid is dishwasher safe (I never put these lids though)Cons for me:- I wash it by hand as advised by producer but it is a bit long to wash without a bottle brush- smallest one is 470ml and it is too big for me being very heavy and tall.- a nonslip bottom would be better as the product is tall- drinking hole is very small I barely get used to itEdit: sometimes it’s a bit hard to drink from it yet never leaked so far.\n')

It can be dropped without breaking (by accident) and will not leak any liquid. It does however have one big negative. Due to the design of the lid it is very difficult to clean properly. Getting into all the small areas of the lid is virtually impossible so be extra careful as after a few weeks use it can get very dirty. My advise is to use a paper napkin when cleaning to ensure you can clean as much as possible.\n')

Within two hours my piping hot coffee was lukewarm & this replicates every time I've used it.  A word of warning too about securing the lid, it's imperative to push it down when screwing it up, to ensure it sits straight on the main cup & the thread connects properly.

I\'ve had Contigo flasks before, same design, but smaller and found them to be pretty good. That\'s why I went for this. Great design, easy to fill, but you need a brush to clean the inside... too long for any fingers.The only things you need to watch out for with these flasks is the rubber seal on the lid. If it\'s not seated correctly (and it\'s a bugger to seat it) after cleaning, the flask will leak. All you need to do is remove the seal again, wet it with clean water and replace it. Don\'t try it dry, its a nightmare.  But if wet, slides in nicely.\n')

Seule séquelle : une marque de coup qui a renfoncé un peu le métal en surface du mug, mais aucun trou, aucune incidence sur son étanchéité.Niveau maintien de température, mon café reste bien chaud pendant deux bonnes heures, mais est encore suffisamment chaud pour être buvable jusqu'à quatre heures si je laisse le capuchon fermé lorsque je ne bois pas. Il remplit donc parfaitement son rôle et je peux profiter de mon café chaque matin jusqu'à midi.Son seul défaut qui ne lui permet pas d'atteindre les 5 étoiles : il arrive parfois (mais très rarement) que le joint d'étanchéité dans le couvercle se retire légèrement et que donc mon café coule. Mais une fois remarqué, celui-ci se replace très facilement et le problème est réglé.En somme, ce mug vaut largement son prix, je ne regrette pas du tout de l'avoir acheté, je recommande.\n")

It is completely leakproof, I just turned upside down with it full of hot Marrakech and not a drop leaked out, and the opening mechanism is easy to flick up with one hand an drink. The only disappointment is hubby washed it before first use and it would appear the coloured coating does not stand up to the quality of the rest of the product (see picture).

It's still a bit tough to use but I guess it should be really.Now the good things:First of all, it really does keep things hot. My carer (I'm disabled) made me a cup of tea but it was too hot to drink so I decided to wait for it to cool. Nearly 2 hours later I remember it and thought it'd be warm at most. It was still too hot to drink!The mug is also lovely to drink from. The area that you drink from is perfectly shaped. It's actually comfortable to drink out of (and I've never even said anything like this about any cup or mug before).The design is beautiful. I got the black one and it really is jet black and as glossy as it appears in the picture. The picture is 100% accurate. The rubber that goes around the cup is very firm and feels like it will last a long time.I was a bit worries about this but the lid is easy to clean. The lids mechanism isn't awkwardly complicated thankfully.And I should add that so far, there's been no issue with leaking, even after I turned it upside down a bunch of times to check :)\n")

And it is cheaper for a reason :) steel great cup, don’t get me wrong but couple of things I dislike compared to Contigo West loop. 1). The auto seal button clicks open and shut very noisily, not smoothly! My 4m old wakes up if I use the cup while she’s sleeping and this is when I mainly need the cup :/  2). It is a bit tricky to drink from, don’t know how to explain, it is just difficult. Not great for cleaning too, one rubber part that closes the hole opening is very difficult to clean and it gets on my nerves :)Everything else is spot on. Just these 2 downsides are very important to me and ruin my experience. If I knew this I would definitely go for West loop no matter the price, that mug is top!I probably wouldn’t have this criticism if I hadn’t had the West loop before. Thanks\n')

Ein bisschen negativ ist auch, dass oben in der Trinköffnung immer etwas Flüssigkeit zurückbleibt, die dann ausläuft, sobald man den Becher schräg hält. Auch können wir ihn nicht in unsere jura-Kaffeemaschine "klemmen", um ihn zu füllen, was bei den emsa-Bechern mit ihrem breiteren Durchmesser kein Problem ist.

Altro problema: si forma della condensa attorno alla bocchetta.Il meccanismo per aprire la bocchetta è ingegnoso ma a base di un materiale gommoso (durerà nel tempo?), questo però crea, specialmente quando la differenza di temperatura tra quella dell\'ambiente e quella del liquido è elevata un effetto "sottovuoto" che rende il meccanismo difficile da aprire.Pulire la zona vicino alla bocchetta non è semplice, e molto spesso è necessario lavare l\'intero tappo.Il meccanismo è ingegnoso, ma poco igienico, a mio parere.\n')

Auch schaut der Gummi Nob der den Ausguss verschließt wirklich nicht mehr appetitlich aus.Also habe ich den Support kontaktiert (via dem Kontaktformular auf der Webseite) um nachzufragen wo/wie ich eine ersatzdichtung oder einenersatzdeckel erwerben kann.Da ich allerdings auch nach dem dritten kontaktversuch vom Support keine Antwort erhalten habe, habe ich auf der Facebook seite von Contigo eine Nachricht hinterlassen.Dort wurde ich innerhalb von kürzester zeit dann gebeten Sie über den Messenger anzuschreiben. Es wurde mir dann allerdings schnell gesagt, das Sie nicht für den EU support zuständig sind und ich doch bitte über die Webseite (das Kontaktformular) den EU support anschreiben soll.Habe dann geantwortet das ich dies schon drei mal gemacht habe und bis heute auf eine Antwort warte.Darauf habe ich wieder die gleiche (copy paste) Antwort bekommen (Sie seien nicht für den EU support zuständig und ich solle via Webseite kontakt mit dem Support aufnehmen).Mein fazit: Produkt ist in ordnung, allerdings kann man den Becher entsorgen sobald man Probleme mit einer der Dichtungen hat, da man weder ersatzt Deckel noch ersatz Dichtungen in der EU bekommen kann.Dies scheint in den USA anders zu sein (wenn es stimmt was man so auf Facebook lesen kann).Deshalb werde ich (wenn der nächste kauf ansteht) nach Herstellern schauen die ersatz Dichtungen anbieten.

('andy', '3.0 out of 5 stars', "\nSome people are blatantly lying about this product, saying it will keep your drink warm for 12 hours or some nonsense.  No, it will keep your drink hot for 2-3 hours max, and you should not expect more from it than that.This was designed for people who want a drink to remain hot for a few hours, so it was designed to be thinner and smaller because of that (it would need to be far thicker and bulkier to keep stuff hot longer).  This is not a thermos you take on a fishing trip or something.  This is designed for people who want it on the way to work, on the way to school, to put at your computer desk while you're busy with something.One negative I will say is this was designed to fail in a year or so (maybe far less if you use it every day), you can see the design choice behind the pop opening is to fail and you buying a new one.  The joints and action are going to weaken from constant use, it's going to start leaking or it won't close properly.  Fatigue of the joints are going to break it and that was a choice they made on purpose so you buy another one.  You also can't screw the top off and drink from it that way, so it forces you to use the pop system to wear it out.Aside from that, it does what it's supposed to and it's not too expensive.  When it breaks I'll be buying a different brand.\n")

So I feel safe bringing it on rough adventures e.g. cycling.It keeps drinks very hot, perhaps too hot for commuting (where you'll want to drink as you go) - but actually this can be mitigated by letting it cool a bit before lidding it.As some reviews have mentioned, the lip of the lid is shaped in such a way that it can dribble either side of your lips down your face, but it is easy to get the knack of preventing this - just don't purse your lips too much. In fact, it's a really comfortable, ergonomic sipping lip.One more thing I love: it's got great capacity. A lot of products of the same overall size have smaller capacity, because they somehow waste a lot of space on insulation walls. This product nails it.I recommend!\n")

Doch hat mich dies noch nie gestoert - aber natuerlich die Undichtigkeiten anderer solcher Becher (nicht von Contigo).Es fehlt mir aber noch die Langzeiterfahrung, also ob z. B. der Trinkverschluss sich mit der Zeit durch den Gebrauch abnutzt und dann doch undicht wird.Jedenfalls: Ich habe nun fuenf verschiedene mobile Trinkbecher / -tassen - und das ist bisher mit Abstand der Beste (da eben dicht ...).Da diese Becher in Kanada nochmals deutlich guenstiger sind und ich gute Erfahrungen gemacht hatte, habe ich dort einen weiteren fuer mich und zwei als 'praktische Souvenirgeschenke' gekauft.Es zeigen sich inzwischen deutliche Teeablagerungen am Verschluss - es kann also sein, dass es dadurch erforderlich werden wird, den Verschluss irgendwann wieder gruendlicher als nur mit heissem Wasser zu reinigen, damit er auch wirklich dicht bleibt.

The only way to avoid this is to open your mouth wide like a trout and pour it in and this is not how I drink tea or coffee.

Ich behandle ihn sehr schonend und reinige innen mit Spülbürste, also ist mir dies schleierhaft.- drückt man den Trinkverschluss zu, spritzt es im Auto nach oben, also muss man dies umständlich mit dem Mund abdecken, will man nach dem Trinken wieder verschließen.der Deckel hat eine Trinkmulde. Hier kann man den gut Kaffee schlürfen, wenn er noch zu heiß ist. Allerdings bleiben oft einige Tropfen in der Mulde, man muss also wirklich alles wegschlürfen.- Die kugelrunde Dichtung im Inneren des Deckels hält eine Zeitlang dicht, lässt aber mit der Zeit nach. Hinlegen im gefüllten Zustand hat dann ein Auslaufen der Trinkflüssigkeit zur Folge.- Die kugelrunde Dichtung verfärbt sich mit der Zeit.- Den Deckel muss man wirklich sehr exakt aufsetzen und fest zudrehen, geht auch schnell schief, dann läufts raus...- Der Becher sowie Deckel sind leider nicht spülmaschinengeeignet.Es ist noch Luft nach oben, was eine verbesserte Konstruktion betrifft.\n')

She has had several designs of these over the years but this was the most difficult to drink from. It also keeps the drink too hot , great if you want to drink it two hours later ( or even longer i suspect ) but not if you get to work in 45 mins . We have also found that the stainless steel mugs affect the taste of the tea . Going back to a China mug with a rubber top . Great sealing mechanism though .\n')

The only downside is that you could be tempted to leave it open, and hence get a spill when you brake etc. The Autoseal types are only open when you grip them and press the knob.For me the big advantage of this one is the lid is wide open for cleaning, really easy, any kitchen sink brush would do. The Autoseal one I had was a pain - you'd need a pipe-cleaner or something to really get into the deep sections to get the brown crud that builds up after a while.By the way - It's worth checking the size and colour selections - sometimes one colour can be substantially cheaper than the others.\n")

('Iris H.', '2.0 out of 5 stars', "\nRegalato a mia moglie per portarsi il cappuccino al lavoro.La tenuta del calore è molto buona e il materiale resistente.Anche bevande fresche si conservano tali per un discreto lasso temporale.Unica vera pecca: l'igiene. Per bere bisogna poggiare le labbra direttamente sul tappo che presenta un foto apribile con un click. Se il contenitore viene tenuto in borsa (come spesso accade) il tappo viene inevitabilmente a contatto con altri oggetti non rendendo la bevuta molto igienica\n")
('Dominique H', '4,0 von 5 Sternen', "\nLove this, fill it up before I walk to work and it's still hot when 4 hours later! I can hold this cup upside down with absolutely no leaks, drips or spills. I hand wash this and there is no issue with the colour of the cup and it looks exactly as the colour I ordered. More than I would usually pay for a travel cup but absolutely worth the money.\n")
