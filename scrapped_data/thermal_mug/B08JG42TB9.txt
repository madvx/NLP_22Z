('Mrs. J Smith', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '\nSeveral years ago I bought this mug in red. I absolutely love it and still use it everyday but since I use it everyday I figured it was worth having a second one. Sadly I was wrong. I bought it again in black. It’s not the same. It’s lighter than my red one and definitely doesn’t keep my coffee hot. My red one keeps the coffee hot for more than an hour nearly two. I was surprised and very impressed by it. So imagine my disappointment when my new black one just doesn’t hold the heat. At first I thought maybe I was mistaken and made the coffee in my cold kitchen so it cooled it faster. But no after testing between the two mugs the newer black one is not good. I wanted to be very sure because I love the red one so much I just didn’t want to say anything without being sure. It’s the exact same brand and cup. I’m added a picture of the two mugs. I will say that the red mug I bought years ago is truly the best travel mug I’ve ever owned. I have gone back to it 2.5 hours later and it’s still warm enough to enjoy the coffee. We also weighed the two mugs the Red weighs 306g while the Black weighs 280g.\n')

But still fits in a standard car cup holder! Why do other travel mugs make them too narrow to fit a hand in!Plus point no.2 it holds heat…properly. No word of a lie I make my tea at 06:00 when I leave to work and at 08:30 it is still hot to drink, it seems to stay at the perfect drinking temperature for ages and ages. Bare in mind I like my tea hotter than a lot of my friends do.
