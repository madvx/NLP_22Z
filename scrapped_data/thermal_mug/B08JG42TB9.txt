Because one of them is leaking right away from the lid I can't use for the purpose I bought them for so sending both back. Look nice to hold. Nice grip and sturdy. Haven't tested how long they hold heat because with a leak they are not going in my bag. Disappointed.They really are just a travel mug. Don't expect to retain heat like a double walled one.I have since this review been refunded for these so good amazon service as usual.\n")

Its not quite as shown in the picture on amazon. The plastic lid has a warmer skin tone/ beige colour. The cup itself is a cool egg white colour. Colour combo okay i guess but just was unexpected. I must say the lid felt and tasted - yes tasted- like cheap plastic. Just used it once after washing it. Definitly will not using it again. We have enough plastics as it is on the foods we consume.  So, will be buying a new travel mug with a more known brand. And this time BPA free.\n')
