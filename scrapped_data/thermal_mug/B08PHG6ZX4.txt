If you want totally leak proof this does have a slight leak if tipped over but the spill will be minimal. For me it was too big for my morning coffee,16 oz is too much at one time. I like a smaller amount at one time. The cup is perfect if you want a large cup of coffee at one time and keep it hot. You need to use the lid to keep it hot. It has a close able sipping opening.\n')

One down side however is that the lid seal is not one hundred percent water tight and it will leak (very slightly) if dropped.\n")

The mug seems to keep my tea warm for a long time even without the slider.  I use this mainly at home because it just won't fit in my car's cup holders.Overall, I think it was a good buy.

It is easy to clean and the exterior powder coating is cool to the touch and affords a firm grip.  The lid silicon seal performs perfectly but the sliding lid-cover will leak if the mug is lean over or tip over.  The lid opening is large enough to allow a silicon strew feed through.  Another potential problem is that there is a very small "gap" where the handle joints the mug.  Water may trap there and corrode the joint. This is an excellent mug to build into a set for a "afternoon coffee or tea get together".\n')

One cannot take a small sip to test the temperature of the contained liquid.  This is a major issue for me & ive gone back back to my old cups.(2) Base is too large to fit in car cup receptacles.

Die bauchige Form, die an ein Weinglas erinnert, hebt sich deutlich von den anderen Formen, die auf dem Markt sind ab.Die Verarbeitung ist sehr wertig. Der Deckel passt gut auf den Becher und f√§llt auch beim Umdrehen nicht ab, auch wenn der Becher gef√ºllt ist. Ganz dicht ist er dabei nicht, was aber auch nicht spezifiziert wurde. Der Deckel l√§sst sich gut auseinander nehmen und im Geschirrsp√ºler reinigen.Der Becher selbst sollte nicht in den Geschirrsp√ºler. Er kann mit aber auch so einfach gereinigt werden.Die Farben sind intensiv und entsprechen der Darstellung.Die Becher sind oben sehr schmal und es l√§sst sich dadurch sehr gut daraus trinken. Den Deckel kann man beim Trinken auch auf dem Becher lassen und durch verschieben einer Abdeckung ergibt sich eine Trink√∂ffnung, aus der man auch sehr gut trinken kann.Zum Schluss noch das Wichtigste. Die Temperatur sinkt bei Zimmertemperatur und geschlossenem Deckel um 10¬∞pro Stunde, was sehr anst√§ndig ist. Hier habe ich aber keine Vergleichswerte.Von au√üen ist am Becher so gut wie keine Erw√§rmung festzustellen, was auch auf eine sehr gute Isolation hindeutet.

('UncleBob', '3.0 out of 5 stars', "\nThis right here is a man-sized mug for man-sized drinking situations. The wine glass shape not only makes it look unique, it's very comfortable to hold and makes you feel like a big man. The included lid is indeed spill-proof when closed and surprisingly leak-resistant when held upside down. The sheer 16oz size of this mug is so big that even while drinking a small coffee out of it you'll feel like a big man. The outer wall remains at comfortable temps while holding your favorite hot or cold beverage so that you can focus on your big man activities instead of worrying about your poor man hands. Unfortunately this mug is not suited for travel because it's so damn big, but it's also very easy to clean for the same reasons. If you're in the office or at home and need a confidence booster that also acts as a beverage container, this is the mug to get.\n")

To that‚Ä¶ With or without the lid, my coffee stays hot for a long time.It‚Äôs easy to clean.The second reason was to use it as a to go mug - here are the negatives‚Ä¶ Even after washing it multiple times I still taste metal when I‚Äôm drinking the coffee. The design of the lid is awkward. When I open the lid to drink my coffee -  the lid seems to not push back far enough, and if I accidentally take a large swig as opposed to a small sip , the coffee does come out the sides of the opening in the lid.Because of the rounded bottom, the coffee mug does not sit in the coffee holder in my car and constantly tips over. And the lid is not secure enough and will leak out the sides.I have a love-hate relationship with this coffee mug, but the more important reason why I bought this was to have hot coffee on the way to work, and for that reasons, it‚Äôs a thumbs down for me.On that note, the reason why I am writing this review is because on my way to work today when my coffee tipped over and spilled out the sides of the lid and all over my console‚Ä¶ I proceeded to stop at the gas station  and throw it out.  We had to break up - it was a dysfunctional relationship.  I was trying to make the coffee mug something that it would never beIf you‚Äôre using this coffee mug for camping, I think it‚Äôs an 8 out of 10.
