But the heat retention is pretty great though. Will keep things hot for at 4 hours after which it'll start cooling down. By the end of the day my tea was still warm.\n")
('Vine Yard', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '\nFirst of all i am very pleased with this item. It‚Äôs the perfect coffee/tea tumbler. Hubby brings coffee to work each night just to kick start him while on his way to work and he‚Äôs not a big coffee drinker so the size is just right for him. It fits on the car‚Äôs cup holder. I love that there are 2 ways to drink from it, depending if you‚Äôre drinking hot or cold drink. It‚Äôs not dishwasher safe but it‚Äôs easy to clean. I used mine for tea and it keeps my tea warm for a long time.\n')

They are durable enough to withstand being tossed around without damaging the cup, but i was only rough with them while empty.......I dont really recommend testing them while full as I did notice a small amount of leakage from 1 of the cups, though it was just a few drops. Overall, I really like these cups, and think they are absolutely a great value for the price. I would definitely buy them again\n')

('Sarah', '5.0 out of 5 stars', "\nI don't think I can get enough insulated bottles when you have kids, it's just a necessity. They can take these to school with them and not worry about leaking. I am always grabbing one of these when we are going on long trips or going to stay out in the hot sun because it keeps the ice water cold. Love them! I use these for cold drinks like ice water and smoothies or ice coffee, and they also work great for hot drinks like coffee and hot chocolate, would recommend! They fit great in cup holders and keep things hot or cold depending on the temperature.\n")

It comes with a straw that can be attached inside but that‚Äôs mostly for cold drinks. It‚Äôs stainless steel inside and doesn‚Äôt have a weird smell. When we used it for a first time it leaked on us a bit :(. Two reasons. Make sure to tighten the lid. It tends to screw in a little unevenly. Also there are two ways you can drink, if you choose to use the side, cup like notch, make sure to snap it strong. Otherwise it leaks there too.Besides that it holds temperature for a few hours so all good! Non slippery in hand either.\n')
('Emily Souza', '5.0 out of 5 stars', "\nHaving a lid that doubles as a sipping lid and a straw lid is genius. I don't have to find a place to store the one I'm not using, and can alternate between how and cold drinks seamlessly. This mug keeps liquids hot for a really long time - 4 hours at least, as that's as long as I have tested it, and my tea was still almost too hot to drink. And it holds ice overnight no problem. The lid is a bit of a pain to clean, but not terrible, and definitely not bad enough to deter me from using/washing it every day. Love love love these mugs!\n")

("That's So Ace", '5.0 out of 5 stars', '\nThese cups are so cute. One for me, one for him. They‚Äôre easier to clean than my older more expensive cups, and they keep my drinks just as warm. The bottom of the cups says Hand Wash Only, but the description says it‚Äôs dishwasher safe, so I‚Äôm not sure which instructions to go by. For now, I‚Äôm sticking with hand washing. I don‚Äôt really use the straw option, mainly because I mostly drink coffee from this cup, but it‚Äôs a nice feature. I love that the cup fits snugly and easily in my backpack pocket and car cup holders, and I can also toss it in my bag without too much concern that it‚Äôs going to leak all over the place (although I‚Äôm always cautious when I have it inside my bag just in case since I‚Äôve had lots of accidents with other cups in the past). These cups are SO giftable‚Äî I‚Äôm thinking about ordering more as Christmas stocking stuffers! Very good quality and good price. Great looking, too. You could use these for kids as well‚Äî they‚Äôre versatile and light!\n')

('IchibanVox', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '\nI got these for hot tea, so don‚Äôt really like that they say ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù down the side. Otherwise, they are great. I like the smaller size for tea. They seem to be well insulated. I don‚Äôt usually let my drink sit for hours, so if it‚Äôs been kept warm/cold for 2-3 hours, that‚Äôs more than enough for me. The lid is 2 in one, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about losing (or storing) one of the lids. The flip closure to the sip side stays in place and so doesn‚Äôt hit you in the nose when you‚Äôre taking a sip. The grippy thing on the bottom keeps you from easily knocking it over. Overall, a decent price for 2 travel mugs and a good product.\n')
('EllieMc', '3.0 out of 5 stars', '\nThere are features I really like about this tumbler and others that I definitely don‚Äôt. I ultimately got these for my sons to bring to soccer practice to keep water cold. We‚Äôll start with the pros. They are easy to hold and fit just right in your hand. I love that there‚Äôs 2 ways you can drink from it. You can either flip the lid and sip from it, or drink from a straw. The rubber bottom is a nice touch. It does a great job at keeping water cold. We go to practice, come home, and then hours later there‚Äôs still ice inside. It also does the same for coffee, but not quite as long.Now for the parts I don‚Äôt like. I‚Äôm not crazy about the plastic lid. The metal tumbler itself is great quality, but I wish the plastic was not as thin, or cheap feeling. The straw is WAY too small for the tumbler. My kids let me know that the first time they used it. It is a tad hard to clean the part the state plugs into on the lid. I wish it didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù in huge letters on the side. I may see if I can find a way to take that off. I don‚Äôt believe that it truly holds 16 ounces. I would say it‚Äôs probably closer to 12 ounces.\n')

I usually just use mine for coffee but I love the straw feature that would give me the option to use it for another drink like water. It's matte color and looks really nice. It holds about 17oz so I'm able to do a 16oz kcup and have a little room for creamer. It's not very tall which is nice because I can fit it more places like shelving in the cabinet. And it's also not too wide at the base so I'm able to fit it in most cup holders which is important to me. Pretty happy and I would definitely get more.\n")

I can fill mine with fresh, hot coffee before I leave home and know it will still be hot hours later. My wife can fill hers with cold water in the morning and even late in the day it will still be cool and refreshing. What we especially like is that no change is needed to switch from a sipping cup to a drinking cup - the built-in straw stays safely out of the way until it's popped up but doesn't interfere with the drinking port. Similarly, our cups keep hot drinks hot and cold beverages cold.Our XIAPIA 17 oz Reusable Coffee Cups with Lids and Straws fit securely in the cup holders of our cars and can be cleaned in the dishwasher.
