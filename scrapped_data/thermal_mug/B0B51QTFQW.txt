('Emma', '4.0 out of 5 stars', "\nI use this at work. It isn't completely leakprof as there is no cover for the mouth or air hole but keeps hot drinks warmer for longer and cold drinks cooler for longer. Perfect for the office. You van purchase a different lid sperately if you want it to be more leakprof. Only downside is the silicone seal for the lid is harder to clean and after a while coffee ect can stain it. Overall, good price, I love it and highy recommend.\n")

('Jennifer higgins', '5.0 out of 5 stars', '\nHandy cup for hot and cold drinks. Keeps drinks hot for a long time so great for the school runs. Comes with cleaning tools. Great also for cold drinks with the good weather coming back. Definitely recommend. Looks great too\n')

Einen habe ich mir allerdings selbst geschenkt und bereits sowohl mit kalten als auch warmen Getr√§nken ausprobiert. Sie halten was sie versprechen. Der Sekt blieb lange kalt und der Kaffee hei√ü. Den Trinkhalm habe ich jedoch noch nicht ausprobiert.\n')

('J of NEL', '5.0 out of 5 stars', "\nBought as birthday gift for colleague.  She has several lidded cups but this is her favourite as it keeps her coffee hotter for longer.  It's cool to touch on the outside no matter how hot the contents and is just the right size.  Classy looking and good quality.  Arrived on schedule and decent price.  Would recommend.\n")
('alexander hadley', '4.0 out of 5 stars', '\nMy wife purchased a set of these items as a gift for her friends. Since then, we have proceeded to buy a collection for ourselves as we were impressed with the product. Coffee stays hot for 3-4 hours.Pros: stylish take on the outdated thermal cup. The modernised appearance will go well as a stand alone item, or alongside other kitchen items. The size is a great size, fitting a large glass of wine, or a normal sized coffee. Easily transportable and does not take up too much room.Cons: there is slight leakage from the lip of the lid when rotated upside down. I have also found the sliding lid difficult to fully clean.Loss of star due to occasional leaking. But would happily purchase the product again. A lovely stylish gift for anyone, both coffee and wine drinkers!\n')

('liz london', '1.0 out of 5 stars', "\nVery nice cup, keeps hot or cold well, spill proof, but don't put it in the dishwasher.Had it less that a month and been through dishwasher twice and the rose gold coloured coating is peeling off, really annoyed, it was a good cup otherwise.Don't believe sellers comments that it's dishwasher safe\n")
('Bernadette Tansley', '2.0 out of 5 stars', '\nReceived this today. Mug itself looks brilliant, lovely colour BUT it came without the straw and cleaning brush and with the odd plastic thing in picture. What is that? Its definately not a straw! Disappointed as I would have liked the straw as it was bought for iced coffee!\n')
